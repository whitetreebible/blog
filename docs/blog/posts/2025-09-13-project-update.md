Wow, it's been over a year and a half since I last posted on my personal blog. Life has been busy, and I've been trying to keep up with everything else. I'm shocked that I didn't post through the Intuit layoff and transition to SwineTech or all the crazy things I've done and learned since then. Here's an update:

## Work
I started at SwineTech in November 2024, and it's been a whirlwind. I've learned so much about the agriculture industry, animal health, and how technology can make a difference in farming practices. The team is small and great to work with, and I'm excited about the projects we're working on. I hired several new engineers, and we're building some really impactful tools for the industry. This summer, we hit the Inc 500 list at 247, which is a huge milestone for us! In October, I'll be flying back to Iowa for an in person visit with the team, some of our clients, and friends from when we lived there many years ago.

## Family
Family life has been busy but rewarding. Our kids are growing up so fast, and it's amazing to see their personalities develop. We've been trying to make the most of our weekends with family outings, trips to the park, and just spending quality time together. My oldest just started middle school, so we're juggling two schools now! My wife has been a rock, managing the household and supporting me through all the changes.

This summer we took a trip to Oregon for a Chinese Heritage adoption camp (that Becca helped organize), went camping with friends out by Idaho City, spend a week in Iowa for work, baptized the 3 older kids in the river, and launched our campus-to-plant church (Hill City West) as Evergreen Church! It's been amazing to see how God is working in our lives and the lives of those around us.

There's some harder stuff too. My dad's battle with cancer has been tough and my brother's unemployment has been heavy. We're leaning on our faith and each other to get through these challenges.

## School
I'm still working on my degree (Masters in Biblical Exposition), and it's been a challenge balancing work, family, and school. But I'm determined to finish what I started. I've been taking classes online, which has helped with the flexibility I need. I love studying theology and ministry, and I'm excited to graduate in October and have a little more autonomy in my continued studies. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in my faith.

## Projects
I've taken up guitar practice a little more regularly. I'm not good, but it is fun and relaxing.

With graduation on the near-horizon, I'm starting to think about what comes next. Becca said I can't get a PhD until I do something with my current degree. I have a few book ideas, a translation project, and a Bible-study tool that I couldn't help but start working on. In fact, the reason I picked up the blog again was to write about some of my interesting findings as I began working on this new project.

I'll need to write a dedicated post about it, but I created a project called [Connections](https://connections.whitetreebible.com) under an umbrella for other Bible study tools called [WhiteTreeBible](https://whitetreebible.com). The first tool is a web app that helps people find connections between different parts of the Bible. It's still in the early stages, but I'm excited about its potential. Once I get it up and running (probably just with Ruth) I'll share more about it.
